One table for just genres, then another which lists all the films you've tagged/favorited/bookmarked, using a foreign key for the genre.
A third table for listing all the genres an entry in the users favorites has.

Pages - List all my movies, list my genres theni choose one and list the movies in that genre, pick a random movie from my list.
Endpoints - Get all. Get by ID. Get by Genre. Get random from list. Get random from third party api. Get random by genre (list & API)

Workout App - Mitchell - Organize the type of exercises you want to do throughout the week. Tracks goals. Third party api: Random muscle facts?

Sport Stats App - Lonnie - Could search for players or teams and get stats. Favorite players.
